    Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code created by a codemaker.
    The codemaker creates a secret code of four numbers between %{code_first} and %{code_last}.
    The codebreaker gets some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen difficulty).
    In each turn, the codebreaker makes a guess of 4 numbers.
    The codemaker then marks the guess with up to 4 signs - + or - or empty spaces.
    + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code and in the same position.
    For example: secret code - 1234, input code - 6264. Number of pluses - 2 (second and fourth position).
    - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code but in a different position.
    An empty space indicates that there is not a current digit in a secret code.
    If codebreaker inputs the exact code as a secret code - codebreaker wins the game.
    If all attempts are spent - codebreaker loses.
    Codebreaker also has some number of hints (depends on chosen difficulty).
    If a user takes a hint - he receives back a separate digit of the secret code.
